# decision-tree
In this project I implemented a decision tree classification algorithm to predict voting patterns of towns in Massachusetts based on data from the 2020 election.
I implemented the learn_tree() and classify() methods, using information gain to learn the tree. The algorithm splits the given dataset into train and test sets randomly.
